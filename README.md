# WinHue3
Controlling the Philips Hue lighting system from your Windows PC.

This is the dev branch of WinHue. I will mostly commit modifications here before moving them to the master branch.
If you want to latest version of WinHue you can download the zip file directly from here. It will contain raw
files without any installer. It will mostlikely contain bugs.
