# WinHue3
Controlling the Philips Hue lighting system from your Windows PC.

This is the dev branch of WinHue. I will mostly commit modifications here before moving them to the master branch.
If you want to latest version of WinHue you can download the zip file directly from here. It will contain raw
files without any installer and might event not compile from time to time. It will mostlikely contain bugs.

Beware that some dll downloaded directly from internet might be blocked. You will have to right click property on each dll and click unblock.
